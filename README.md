## Exploratory Data Analysis

#### <ins>Causes of Deaths</ins>
Through a holistic review of SuperLife’s policyholder data, we have identified the mortality trends and contributive variables that must be considered in the health program design. Our analysis, on both a population and region level, revealed the leading causes of death to be neoplasms (33.5%), diseases of the circulatory system (30%) and external causes of morbidity (8.8%) as detailed in the 2 graphs below, a trend largely consistent across all Lumarian regions and product lines (SPWL and T20). Consequently, our program has been specifically tailored to offer incentives that address these particular health concerns with no product-level or geographical differentiation.

#### <ins>Gender Distribution</ins>
Our exploration of the genders of SuperLife’s policyholders has led us to our findings that females join the policy slightly earlier than males, but dead policyholders generally got policies much later. Analysis of the gender of dead policyholders by regions, as shown in the graph below, illustrates all regions having significantly higher numbers of male policyholder deaths than females, especially for regions 1-3. Out of the total dead policyholder count, males accounted for more than twice the number of female policyholders.

Analysis of the gender of policyholders based on product revealed a similar distribution of male and female policyholder deaths for both SPWL and T20 products but in proportion to the number of policyholders, more are dying under SPWL products. Our findings are illustrated in the graph below:

#### <ins>Underwriting Classes</ins>
Additionally, by examining the distribution of underwriting classes among the Lumarian population, as indicated in the graph below, we have discovered that policyholders predominantly fall into the low-risk category (633,198) within the overall claims dataset, yet majority of those who died were categorised as moderate risk (16,187).

A risk profile assessment on smokers’ underwriting classes, as seen in the graph below, highlighted a pronounced discrepancy: smokers only fall into moderate or high-risk underwriting classes indicating a skewed risk distribution, whereas non-smokers were distributed more evenly between very low to high-risk underwriting classes. Hence, smoking has been considered as a significant risk factor.

In addition, sub-group analysis of smoker status revealed circulatory system diseases as the foremost health issue among smokers, contrasting with neoplasms in non-smokers, as illustrated in the graph below:

#### <ins>Marketing Distribution Channels</ins>
Upon examining the traction of different distribution channels across all Lumarian regions, detailed in the left graph below, Plus Advisory’s marketing recommendation will primarily focus on agents and online platforms given their consistent popularity. Adopting a product-wise lens, as illustrated in the right graph below, we would advise the concentration of advertising budget and other resources on agents for SPWL given their predominance and even investment across all channels for T20.
